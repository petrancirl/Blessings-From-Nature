				<h2>Counseling Therapy</h2>
					<h3>-The blessings from nature-</h3>
						<p>If you feel constantly tired, drained, dissatisfied with how thing is or just feeling down, it’s a first sign that you need to do something. It won’t just go away.<br>
						If you are feeling uncreative, creatively blocked or stuck in the vicious circle of bad habits… Or you don’t see your life purpose or you’re successful self-saboteur (workaholic, emotional eater, commitment phobic, procrastinator) it’s a sign that your life (and your energy) needs a shift.</p>
						<p>All those „why-is-it-happening-to-me“, „why-am-I-attracting-the-wrong-person“, „I-don’t-deserve-this“… means that you could use some push from outside.</p>

					<h3>What can you expect from this counseling?</h3>
						<p>Support. Clarity. Guidance. Inspiration. Creativity. Wellbeing. Encouragement.</p>

I use Bach Flower Remedies as a gentle, natural and holistic way of restoring emotional, mental or energetical balance.</p>
