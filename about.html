					<h2>Blessings From Nature.</h2>
						<p>Life is full of ups and downs and we’re trying 	to master both. 
						<p>My motto is “search for the solution not the problem”… for the problem is always there visible to us, what is hidden, however, is the solution. </p>
						<p>I believe that both “The doctor” and “The patient” are within each of us and that my job is to awaken the doctor so that he could cure the patient.</p> 
						<p>I believe that each illness whether physical or mental is meant to draw our attention to the fact that something in the way we run our lives is not good for us. I convey this way of thinking to all my patients, those who seek relief for their body, mind and spirit.</p>
						<p>I am here for you, but for myself as well, because I love and believe in what I do.</p> 
						<p>Blesings From Earth has been successfully disposing to his clients for many years, constantly searching for new knowledge and methods. As part of my business, I work on discovering the causes of your problems as well as eliminating them, with a great help of Bach Flower Remedies.</p>
						<p>My successful formula is a combination of state of the mind, soul and body and individual approach to each client</p>
					<h3>From my heart to yours, Lena!</h3>

			<div class="Combination">
				<h2>Combination of remedies and how they work together.</h2>
					<p>All Bach flower essences are supplied at Stock Level so they can be diluted into a treatment bottle (as suggested by Dr Bach) or used directly from from the stock if preferred. When used individualy the act the best but for some life situations you need more than one remedy so it is good to make a combination of essences</p>
					<p>You can combine up to seven different essences in the single treatment bottle.</p>
					<p>It's easy to make your own Bach Flower Remedy combination. Just put 2 drops of each Remedy you require into a glass dropper bottle. Add up to 30ml of spring water plus a teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar or brandy to act as a preservative.</p>
