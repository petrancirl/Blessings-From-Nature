				<p>"Disease of the body itself is nothing but the result of the disharmony between soul and mind. Remove the disharmony, and we regain harmony between soul and mind, and the body is once more perfect in all its parts."</p>

				<h2>Bach Flower remedies</h2>
					<h3>-The blessings from nature-</h3>
						<p>Bach Flower Essences or Bach Flower Remedies (flower therapy) are gentle, holistic and natural way of removing misbalance on all levels: mental, emotional, energy and body.
						These remedies help overcoming obstacles preventing us to achieve harmony with ourselves as well as our surroundings, and are used worldwide as a complementary therapy for more than 80 years.
						<p>The concept of Bach Flower Remedies is based on a notion that every human being is healthy and happy when is in balance with its own nature – when we are authentic.
						Main cause of physical illness is a misbalance in soul-mind-body relation. Physical symptoms are just an external manifestation of a disturbed inner balance.
						The ultimate purpose of these remedies is to remove any obstacle in life flow and to achieve harmony of the Soul-Mind-Body.
						These remedies help increase the energy levels, treating the person as a whole, opening channels of our Being and unlocking potential, helping the Soul to reconnect with yourself.
						Bach’s 38 flower remedies are a powerful helper on a path of self-realization, treating 38 known negative mental and emotional states (e.g. apathy, possessiveness, intolerance, sorrow, anger, fears…).
						<p>Remedies have no negative side effects and can be safely used even in pregnancy, for babies, pets or plants.</p>
